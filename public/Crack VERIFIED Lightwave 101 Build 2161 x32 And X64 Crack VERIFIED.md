## Stereo Camera Rig Options
 
One of the most exciting features of Lightwave 10.1 Build 2161 is the support for stereoscopic 3D production. With the growing demand for stereo 3D content in film, television and gaming, you need a tool that can help you create stunning stereo 3D visuals with ease. Lightwave 10.1 Build 2161 gives you access to all major stereo camera rigs, including parallel, toe-in, and off-axis[^4^]. You can also correct for toe-in distortion in the animation pipeline dynamically[^4^]. You can adjust the interocular and convergence points over time to track stereo changes within a shot[^4^]. You can also interact with the stereo camera planes and convergence point in OpenGL[^4^]. With Lightwave 10.1 Build 2161, you can deliver realistic and immersive stereo 3D experiences to your audience.
 
## Viewport Preview Renderer (VPR)
 
Another feature that makes Lightwave 10.1 Build 2161 stand out is the Viewport Preview Renderer (VPR). The VPR allows you to interact and adjust lights, textures, volumetrics and more within the viewport[^4^]. You can also use the VPR to view updates, render realistic environmental walkthroughs, and perform virtual location scouts[^4^]. The VPR is fast and accurate, giving you instant feedback on your work. Lightwave 10.1 Build 2161 extends the functionality of the VPR with the support of clip maps, object and distance dissolve, and improved nodal shaders like the new Skin material node[^4^]. The Skin material node uses a proprietary subsurface scattering model for a simple and realistic way to create skin textures[^4^]. With the VPR, you can achieve stunning results in less time.
 
## Import and Export Capabilities
 
Lightwave 10.1 Build 2161 also offers more powerful import and export capabilities with FBX, MDD, and integrated Autodesk Geometry Cache support[^4^]. You can include or exclude models, morphs, animations, cameras and lights upon export[^4^]. You can also import joints as Lightwave bones for greater compatibility with other programs[^4^]. These features allow you to integrate Lightwave 10.1 Build 2161 into any production pipeline seamlessly.
 
## Other Features and Enhancements
 
Lightwave 10.1 Build 2161 also offers many other features and enhancements that can improve your workflow and quality of work. Some of these include:
 
- Virtual Studio Toolsâsupports InterSense Virtual Camera Tracking System (VCamâ¢) and 3Dconnexion SpaceNavigatorâ¢ 3D mouse, allowing interaction with models and scenes in real time[^4^]
- FiberFXâ¢âhair and fur shader now supports VPR and includes improved speed, stability and displacement handling[^4^]
- Linear Color Space Workflowâimproves color accuracy and consistency with new support for .ICC/.ICM monitor profiles[^4^]
- Multi-threaded mesh evaluation optimization and sub-d mesh freezing accelerationâimproves performance and speed of mesh operations[^4^]

## Conclusion
 
Lightwave 10.1 Build 2161 is a powerful tool for 3D animation that offers many new features and enhancements that can help you create stunning visuals in less time. Whether you work alone or in a team, Lightwave 10.1 Build 2161 can integrate into any production pipeline smoothly. If you want to learn more about Lightwave 10.1 Build 2161
