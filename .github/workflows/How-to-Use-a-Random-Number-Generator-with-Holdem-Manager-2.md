# How to Use a Random Number Generator with Holdem Manager 2
 
Holdem Manager 2 (HM2) is a popular poker software that helps you track and analyze your poker hands, as well as your opponents' tendencies. However, HM2 does not have a built-in feature to display a random number generator (RNG) on your HUD. This can be useful for making decisions based on mixed strategies, such as bluffing or calling with a certain frequency.

Fortunately, there is a way to use an external RNG with HM2, thanks to a third-party software called StarsHelper. StarsHelper is a tool that enhances your experience on PokerStars, by providing various features such as hotkeys, bet sizing presets, pot odds display, and more. One of these features is the ability to create custom HUD elements, including a RNG.
 
In this article, we will show you how to set up and use a RNG with HM2 and StarsHelper. Note that this method only works on PokerStars, and you need to have both HM2 and StarsHelper installed and running on your computer.
 
## Step 1: Create a RNG HUD element in StarsHelper
 
The first step is to create a RNG HUD element in StarsHelper. To do this, follow these steps:
 
1. Open StarsHelper and go to the HUD tab.
2. Click on the Create button and select Random from the drop-down menu.
3. A new HUD element will appear in the list. You can customize its name, position, size, color, font, and range. The range determines the minimum and maximum values that the RNG can generate. For example, if you want a RNG that shows a number between 0 and 100, set the range to 0-100.
4. Click on the Save button to save your changes.

## Step 2: Add the RNG HUD element to your HM2 HUD
 
The next step is to add the RNG HUD element to your HM2 HUD. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Open HM2 and go to HUD Options.
2. Select Site Options from the left menu and choose PokerStars from the drop-down menu.
3. Check the box that says Enable StarsHelper additional HUD support.
4. Select HUD Settings from the left menu and choose your preferred HUD configuration from the drop-down menu.
5. Click on the + button next to Player Stats and select Add New Stat.
6. A new stat will appear in the list. You can customize its name, description, category, and format. The format determines how the stat will be displayed on your HUD. For example, if you want a RNG that shows a number between 0 and 100 with two decimal places, set the format to %.2f.
7. In the Expression field, enter [SH\_Random], where Random is the name of your RNG HUD element in StarsHelper. If you used a different name, replace Random with your name.
8. Click on OK to save your changes.
9. Drag and drop your new stat to your desired position on your HUD layout.
10. Click on Apply and OK to close the HUD Options window.

## Step 3: Use the RNG with HM2
 
The final step is to use the RNG with HM2. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Launch PokerStars and join a table.
2. You should see your HM2 HUD appear on the table, along with your RNG stat.
3. The RNG stat will show a random number every time a new hand is dealt. You can use this number to guide your decisions based on mixed strategies. For example, if you want to bluff with a certain hand 25% of the time, you can bluff when the RNG shows a number between 0 and 25.

Note that the RNG stat is only visible to you and not to other players. Also, using a RNG does not guarantee that you will win or lose any hand. It is just a tool that can help you implement mixed strategies more effectively.
